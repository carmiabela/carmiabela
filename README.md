## FindMyParentsScratch 2017

Looking back on my old projects, I found this game I made on scratch and thought it was pretty cool. When I was about 9 (year 4), I made an interactive story game with about 6 levels, each one getting harder. The aim of this game is to overcome each challenge in order to rescue your parents.

 A Character will tell you that they've their lost remote and you'll move objects in the room to find it.

## TeachingPrimaryGirlsToCode 2023
In this repository, I will add coding presentation that I've created. These slides will be those of which I've used to teach young girls in years 4-6 how to code using scratch. At the end of this young they will be all signing up for and submitting their projects into a coding competition called [IKCC scratch](https://www.ikcc.info/).
