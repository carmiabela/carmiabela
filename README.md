This is a simple swift game I made in year 8; it was featured as part of my school's apple distinguished video.
A Character will tell you that they've their lost remote and you'll move objects in the room to find it.

Looking back on my old projects, I found this game I made on scratch and thought it was an absolute gem. When I was about 9, I made this interactive story game with about 6 levels, each one getting harder. The aim of this game is to overcome each challenge in order to rescue your parents.
