 This is a simple swift game I made; it was featured as part of my school's Apple distinguished video.
 A Character will tell you that they've their lost remote and you'll move objects in the room to find it.

 In this repository, I will add coding presentation that I've created. These slides will be those of which I've used to teach young girls in years 4-6 how to code using scratch. At the end of this young they will be all signing up for and submitting their projects into a coding competition called [IKCC scratch](https://www.ikcc.info/).
